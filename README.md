# Repo for ASED Dialogue Responder 

Dependencies/requirements can be found in `requirements.txt`

For most basic use, download [model checkpoint file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HPuDctKnlcS6QYGfwYVdqhUEcSVASDji/view?usp=sharing) and unzip it in the same location as the repo. 

Run `python app.py` and you can get dialogue responses at this endpoint: `http://0.0.0.0:5000/ased_api/input=<dialogue_history1>&input=<dialogue_history2>`.
